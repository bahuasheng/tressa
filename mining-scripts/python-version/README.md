Python 3 scripts using abstraction for pipelining

TODO:
- Extract all the changed assertions between revisions into internal representation
- Add naive AST parser for assertions (for more powerful querying)
- Add tests (Perhaps I should have already started this on some of my more confusing regex functions)
- Extend to finding all current assertions within a single revision (and tests)
- Write some queries!
